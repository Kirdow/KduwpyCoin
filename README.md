# KduwpyCoin [![License][license-img]][license-file]
Bare bones cryptocurrency demo made in Python 3.9

## About the project
After watching a [video][fireship-video] by [Fireship][fireship-channel] I decided to breifly implement [his code][fireship-code] in Python. Although I don't plan it to be an official Python port on his repo, this repo did start with inspiration from his repository.

## Setting up and running
For setting up, there's ``SETUP.bat`` for windows and ``SETUP.sh`` for UNIX/POSIX.

For running, there's ``RUN.bat`` for windows and ``RUN.sh`` for UNIX/POSIX.

There's also ``SETUP_AND_RUN.bat`` and ``SETUP_AND_RUN.sh`` if you want to do both at the same time.

## Contributing
As this repository is primarily just me learning cryptocurrency development and the means around it, I might not accept every or most pull request. However as I always want to learn more, I'm open to whatever you have to offer if you do come across some good and/or needed improvements. If anything, feel free to open an issue or PR and I might take a look at it.
